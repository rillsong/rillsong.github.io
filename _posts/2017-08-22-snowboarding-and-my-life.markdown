## SHINee
Hi, let's be friend if you also enjoy SHINee's music and performance!

>
Shinee debuted in May 2008 with their first EP, Replay, on SBS' 
Inkigayo with their single "Replay". The group gained attention for starting a fashion 
trend amongst students, which the media dubbed the "Shinee Trend". In August 2008,
the group released their first Korean studio album, The Shinee World, which won Newcomer Album of the Year at the 23rd Golden Disc Awards. Shinee further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean music scene with follow-up singles "Ring Ding Dong" and "Lucifer". "Ring Ding Dong" charted on top of several Korean music charts and gained popularity all over Asia. "Lucifer" was nominated for the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2010 for its outstanding choreography. In 2012 the group released Sherlock, which became the fifth most sold album of the year with over 180,000 copies sold. The group has also been included in the Forbes 
list of Korea Power Celebrity multiple times, once in 2014 and again in 2016.
