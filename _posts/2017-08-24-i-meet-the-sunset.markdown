**Team Leader**, M&A Case Competition, Fudan University, Shanghai  
• Spearheaded six group meetings and facilitated communication among members and target company representatives  
• Summarized and visualized company’s business and investment structure and conducted comparable evaluation  
  
**Data Driven Project**  
One project I have completed is to detect fake reviews. 
During the project, I performed textual data preprocessing, programmed N-gram language model and applied Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. 
One challenge I encountered was performing preprocessing on large sca le of text data for higher classification accuracy. To achieve the goal, I conducted extensive research in preprocessing methods such as deleting stop word, handling contraction or conducting stemming, and compared performance of each single method and their combinations. I also tuned parameters carefully for unknown-word handling and smoothing methods. As a result, I improved up to 15% prediction accuracy and was listed in top 10% in the competition. 
  
**Commnication**  
One example that highlights my communication skill was when I participated in a mathematical modeling project.
The goal of the project was to analyze a financial problem using mathematical equations (differential equations).
During the project, I collaborated with team members from a variety of backgrounds, so I would use analogies to explain concepts. For example, I would make the concept “Utility” easier to understand by drawing analogies to “happiness” (Explained “futures” by giving examples). 
I also created concise visualizations of the “utility function” using simple number intput so that I was able to “tell a story” in a straightforward way that everyone could understand.
Our work was selected as an exemplary project, which validated my strength of storytelling.
